# About me
The quality of work is mainly influenced by three factors: experience, passion, and repetition.

For the past 10+ years I worked mainly on iOS apps. Ever since my youth I was interested in games though.  
While still being active as an iOS developer I am constantly getting more into Unity development.

Therefore, I am available in both areas and would describe myself as a senior iOS and junior Unity developer.

# Resume
You can find me resume in this reposity as a [Word](https://github.com/DominicFrei/aboutme/raw/master/Dominic_CV_public.docx) and [PDF](https://github.com/DominicFrei/aboutme/raw/master/Dominic_CV_public.pdf) document.  
I am happy to provide contact details to all my references on request.
